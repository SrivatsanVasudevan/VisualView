## Welcome to VisualView : The coding questions visualization website!

VisualView.com helps in visualizing basic coding interview questions to help in your preparation process and provide a new perspective to preparing for coding interviews!

The website currently has visualizations of the following coding questions:

### FizzBuzz: The classic interview question!

### Binary Search: Did you just lose your keys? Find them in O(log(N)) time!

### Kadane's Algorithm: Dynamic Programming made easy!

... and a lot more coming soon!

This project was created using ReactJS, Javascript, HTML and SCSS.

If you wish to learn more about this project, here's a demo of the visualization of [Kadane's algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z9a9jYL63U&pp=QAA%3D).

If you wish to run this project, all you have to do is clone the project, then in your terminal, navigate to the zip file, extract it and run the command yarn install and then run yarn start to get the project up and running! (You will need to have NodeJS and Yarn pre-installed to perform the above steps.)
